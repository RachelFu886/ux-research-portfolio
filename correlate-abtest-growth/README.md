# A/B Testing – Activation Funnel Optimization (Correlate AI)

## Overview
I designed and analyzed a real-world A/B test that improved activation rate by **+9%**. The project focused on identifying friction points in the user onboarding funnel and validating a redesigned interaction sequence.

## Hypothesis
A simplified onboarding screen with clearer CTA hierarchy will increase completion and activation rates.

## Experiment Setup
- **Method:** Randomized A/B test  
- **Sample size:** ~4,000 users  
- **Metrics:**  
  - Activation rate  
  - Completion rate  
  - Time-on-task  
  - Drop-off points  
- **Tools:** SQL, Python, internal analytics dashboard  
- **Duration:** 14 days  

## Analysis
- Cleaned and aggregated event-level logs  
- Compared conversion rates using a two-proportion z-test  
- Controlled for traffic variations and device type  
- Visualized funnel drop-offs  
- Verified no negative downstream effects  

## Results
- **Activation Rate:** +9% uplift  
- **Completion Rate:** +6.5%  
- **Drop-off reduced** at step 2 (17% → 11%)  
- Findings statistically significant (**p < 0.05**)  

## Impact
- Redesign deployed globally  
- Framework extended to other onboarding flows  
- Demonstrated value of experiment-driven UX/product decisions
