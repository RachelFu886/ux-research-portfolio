# UX Research & Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases my mixed-methods UX research and applied data science work.  
Each project highlights a different research or analytical skill set, including experiment design, A/B testing, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

## 👩‍💻 About Me
I am a mixed-methods UX Researcher and Applied Data Scientist with a background in behavioral science.  
I combine experiments, surveys, quantitative modeling, and data analysis to understand user behavior and support product decisions.
